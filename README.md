## How to Use the Smarter Semicolon Plugin

The Smarter Semicolon Plugin enhances your coding efficiency by providing customizable actions to insert semicolons in your code. Here's how to get started:

1. Open **Settings** by going to *File > Settings* (on Windows/Linux) or *IntelliJ IDEA > Preferences* (on macOS).
2. Navigate to **Keymap** to customize how you trigger the plugin's actions.
3. In the Keymap settings, search for "**semicolon**" to find the plugin's actions. You can assign or change shortcuts for the following actions:
   - **1st Action: Add Semicolon and Leave Caret in Current Position** - This action inserts a semicolon at the end of the current line without moving the caret. It is commonly set to `Alt+;`.
   - **2nd Action: Add Semicolon and Move Caret to End of Line** - This action adds a semicolon at the end of the line and moves the caret to the end of this line. The typical shortcut is `Ctrl+;`.
   - **3rd Action: Add Semicolon and Move Caret to New Line** - This action inserts a semicolon at the end of the current line and moves the caret to the beginning of the next line. It is usually assigned to `Ctrl+Shift+;`.

After setting up the shortcuts, you can easily insert semicolons in your code with your preferred caret behavior, improving your development workflow.
